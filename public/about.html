<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Lavetta Gray. I have a background in the credit card processing industry.
  I've been in this industry for 13 years and learned so much on the back end about
  the business. I started in Customer Service, from there I've worked in our Research
  Department where I have learned so many different back office processes and procedures
  which has always allowed me to have an interest in learning so much more about the industry.
  I am now licsenced and certified as an expert in the payment card industry. I've
  worked closely with our IT team to resolve issues for our ISO Agents and Merchants. 
  I love helping people and assisting with building their business. I have such a respect
  for entrepreneurs.<thead>

<p>Another fact about me is that I love all there is to know about real estate. Its 
  such a very useful tool for your own personal life as well as being able to use it
  to grow a business. I love watching people fix, flip and stage homes. I know the 
  process is not easy and to see it come to life is a beautiful thing to me. I am
  a bit creative so I love design and stagingSi</p>

  <p> I also love making jewelry. I make bracelets. It allows me to get my creative
    juices flowing and its therapeautic for me. One of the most relaxing past times
    I could have. I would love to learn how to sew as well. I always have had an eye
    for fashion and interior design.
